# Requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have the all of the requirements but SWAN still does not work for you, you can run our [**Tool**](https://download.owswan.com/Disable.bat), run it as Administrator and restart your computer.

If that still does not fix your issue feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/swan) and create a ticket, we'd be more than happy to help.
{% endhint %}

## Requirements

[Visual Studio Runtime Packages](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/)

Remember to disable all features in your Antivirus before injecting SWAN to prevent BSOD's.
